# get-gatsby-components
Simple helper script for cloning all of the components for gatsby themes in a project to allow for customization.

#### Setup
- Clone the repo
- run `npm link` in the project
- Navigate to your gatsby project and run `get-gatsby-components`

#### Note
I just wrote this as a helper script for myself, it's not a good implementation. 
I also wrote it for use in my first Gatsby project, it might not actually solve a problem :shrug:
